**Guitar Clamps**

This project was just to make my classical guitar "wearable".

**Goal:**
Play classical guitar standing with guitar strap

**Issue:**
No pins for attaching guitar strap *And drilling pin into guitar is risky...*

**Solution:**
CAD and print detachable clamps with pins for guitar strap!

**Somethings I learned along the way:**
* Designing/printing screws is challenging but surprisingly not as hard as gears!
* Printing holes is extremely annoying due to the plastic... and holes... shrinking upon cooling
* You can design very beautiful, organic designs on onshape, wooo Bezier Curves!!!

Time: *Started and completed Summer 2023*
