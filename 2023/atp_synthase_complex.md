The **ATP Sythase Complex** is sooooo coooooool!

It converts ion concentration differences and flow to mechanical movement and the endergonic creation of ATP from ADP and P!

_like how linear actuators convert rotation to linear motion, or how mecanum wheels convert diagonal to x-y component movement, like any and every crazy robot in existence..._ 

BUT ON THE MICRO SCALE and MORE COMPLEX and MORE ABUNDANT and MADE BY CHANCE!!! Wooo nature!!!!!
