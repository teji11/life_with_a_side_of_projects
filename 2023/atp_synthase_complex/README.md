The **ATP Sythase Complex** is sooooo coooooool!

It converts ion concentration differences and flow to mechanical movement and the endergonic creation of ATP from ADP and P!

_like how linear actuators convert rotation to linear motion, or how mecanum wheels convert diagonal to x-y component movement, like any and every crazy robot in existence..._ 

BUT ON THE MICRO SCALE and MORE COMPLEX and MORE ABUNDANT and MADE BY CHANCE!!! Wooo nature!!!!!

**How the mechanism works:**

Thanks to the electron transport chain and its newly generated H+ ion concentration difference inside and outside the inner mitochondrial membrane...

H+ ion diffusion from outside the inner mitochondrial membrane to inside is used to structurally shift the F0 H+ ion acceptor.

This chemical to mechanical change is translated to a connected part of the complex, F1, which binds ADP to P, forming ATP.

**ADP + P + 2H+out â‡Œ ATP + H2O + 2H+in**

**How the model works:**

*This model is of course... a model, so being on the macro-scale, there are some changes made to the reactants, reaction, and products to be visible and understandable.*

* Stimuli/Reactants
  * Real: H+ ions
  * Model: Copper balls (electrically-conductive)
* Result/Products
  * Real: ATP
  * Model: Light (LEDs light up)
* Process
  * Real: Chemical (H+ ions diffuse) --> Mechanical (F0 changes) --> Mechanical (F1 changes) --> Chemical (ADP+P-->ATP)
  * Model: Gravitational (copper balls fall) --> Mechanical (F0 rotates) --> Mechanical (F1 rotates) --> Electrical (Circuit closes, LED lights)
 

Time: *Started Winter/Spring 2023* *Paused Summer 2023, will complete 2024*
